// Geometry for the time machine.
//
// Every number here was measured off the supplied reference. The six timeline
// nodes were located by detecting their glow, and a least-squares circle fit
// through them closed to within +/-3px — so the timeline really is a circular
// arc, and it is rebuilt here as one rather than approximated by a spline
// through hand-placed points. That matters for the interaction: the cursor is
// projected onto this same arc to decide which year the visitor is reaching
// for, so the maths the scene is drawn with and the maths it is read with are
// the same maths.
